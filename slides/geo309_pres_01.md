* What is critical cartography and GIS?

  * Crampton, J. 2010. What is critical cartography and 

GIS. In Crampton, J. (2010) Mapping: A critical 
introduction to cartography and GIS. Oxford: 
Blackwell. 39-48.

 

 

What is GIS?

* Geographic Information Systems

  * “A powerful set of tools for collecting, storing, retrieving, 

transforming and displaying spatial data from the real world.” - 
Burrough (1986)

  * “Automated systems for the capture, storage, retrieval, 

analyses and display of spatial data.” - Clarke (1995)

* GIScience

  * Theory and Practice

 

 

GIS vs. Map

* GIS

  * Links map features with lists of attributes
  * Displays map features based on their attributes
  * Link between map features and attributes is 

dynamic

 

 

GIS vs. Map

 

 

A Brief History of GIS

* Computer Mapping (1970s) 

  * automates the cartographic process

* Spatial Database Management (1980s)
  * links computer mapping techniques with 

traditional database capabilities

* GIS Modeling (1990s)

  * representation of relationships within and 

among mapped data

* Web Mapping (2000s)
  * digital mapping online

 

 

Major Components of a GIS

* Hardware
* Software
* Personnel

 

 

Major Components of a GIS

* Hardware

  * Computer (Desktop, Laptop, Tablet, Mobile)
  * Internet/Intranet Infrastructure
  * GPS/Satellite
  * Data Storage (Physical, Cloud)
  * Digitizers & Scanners
  * Printers and Plotters

 

 

Major Components of a GIS

● Software   * Data Input

 

 

Major Components of a GIS

● Software   * Data Storage/Management

  * Computer hardware

* Hard Drive, Thumb Drives, Optical

  * Database Management System (DBMS)

* Store (retains integrity)
* Manage (minimum access times, simple updates)
* Analyze (several tools: PostGIS)

 

 

Major Components of a GIS

● Software   * Geographic Analysis System

  * Reclassification
  * Overlay
  * Query
  * Buffer
  * Map Algebra
  * Models and Simulations

 

 

Major Components of a GIS

● Software   * Statistical Analysis
  * Traditional statistical procedures

* Chi-square
* Coincidence analysis
* Principle component analysis

  * Geostatistical procedures

* Inverse distance
* Semivariogram
* Kriging

 

 

Major Components of a GIS

● Software   * Data Output & Visualization

 

 

Major Components of a GIS

● Software   * Data Transformation

  * Transformation needed to remove errors
  * Bring them to up to date
  * Match them to other data sets

 

 

Application of GIS

* Natural Resources Management
* Facility Management
* Land Information System
* Business Intelligence/Analysis
* Emergency Response System
* Data Science
* More…

 

 

Benefits of GIS

* Facilitates

  * Understanding of a problem in spatial context
  * Generation & analysis of spatial data
  * Analytic updates of non-spatial data/information
  * Visualization

* Facilitates decision making processes

  * Knowledge, power, control

 

 

Limitations of GIS

* Not a “covers-all” technique
* Often oversold
* Information is not a solution

  * Depends on decision making process

* Prone to human error

  * Hypothesis, data processing, modeling

 

 

Limitations of GIS
* Lack of compatible data limits performance
* Inherent uncertainty of data

  * Limitation of GIS tools to adjust/cope

* Running costs

  * Licenses & Support
  * Data Sources and proprietary formats
  * Adoption, Development, Learning Curves
