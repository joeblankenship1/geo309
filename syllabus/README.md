### Course Description

This course introduces students to geographic information systems, their concepts, and their utility. Topics addressed include data collection, processing, analysis, and visualization. Students will learn about types of geographic data and how these data types are to be used. Students will survey and analyze geographic information on the web and learn how to collect spatial data using global positioning systems (GPS) and other technologies.
The purpose of this course is far more than learning GIS as a set of tools. This course is intended to help the student critically engage with the subject matter of GIScience and how it is used to model the spaces and places of everyday life. In doing this, we will examine data, tools, techniques, and outputs of GIS in order to expose the relationship between the cartographer, the map, and those who are being represented by the map. This entails understanding how spatial knowledge and power affect matters of globalized economy, politics, social relations, and much more.

### Course Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

1. Discuss the foundational histories, theories, and practices in GIS
2. Process and analyze spatial data
3. Produce maps and geovisualizations
4. Critically engage with and critique spatial information

### Grading

Unless otherwise indicated by the instructor, all assignments, quizzes, and projects will be provided through Canvas.

1. **Attendance** Attending class will be important for your success in this class. You will be expected to participate in class and to collaborate with your fellow students. Consistent class attendance will ensure that you have all materials and information needed for successful completion of your homework, quizzes, and final project.
2. **Article Write-ups** Three times during the semester, students will complete reports on assigned readings. Each report will be 750 words (minimum) reflecting on these readings. Students will be expected to participate in a class discussion on the topic(s) of the readings. Discussion will be used to summarize the readings as well as to explore the themes that emerged in your writings.
3. **Homework** Each week the instructor will direct you to an assignment that must be completed by a specified date. The assignment instructions will be available on Canvas, indicating what is to be turned in for grading.
4. **Quizzes** There will be two quizzes throughout the course of the semester. Questions will be short response. These will reflect material covered in lecture, lab, and assigned readings. Unless noted, you will be given time at beginning of class on the day they are assigned (typically Thursdays) to complete the quiz, though you may complete them at home. Due Date: Midnight on the day they are assigned
5. **Final Project** The semester will culminate in the submission and presentation of a final project. For the final project, you will be asked to complete a GIS project and to present the results to the class. I encourage you to begin to identify topics and appropriate data sets early. I am always open to meeting to discuss potential projects. Additional guidance will be provided via Canvas. Due Date: ______.
