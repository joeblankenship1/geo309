### Course Description

This course introduces students to geographic information systems, their concepts, and their utility. Topics addressed include data collection, processing, analysis, and visualization. Students will learn about types of geographic data and how these data types are to be used. Students will survey and analyze geographic information on the web and learn how to collect spatial data using global positioning systems (GPS) and other technologies.
The purpose of this course is far more than learning GIS as a set of tools. This course is intended to help the student critically engage with the subject matter of GIScience and how it is used to model the spaces and places of everyday life. In doing this, we will examine data, tools, techniques, and outputs of GIS in order to expose the relationship between the cartographer, the map, and those who are being represented by the map. This entails understanding how spatial knowledge and power affect matters of globalized economy, politics, social relations, and much more.

### Course Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

1. Discuss the foundational histories, theories, and practices in GIS
2. Process and analyze spatial data
3. Produce maps and geovisualizations

1. **Attendance** Attending class will be important for your success in this class. You will be expected to participate in class and to collaborate with your fellow students. Consistent class attendance will ensure that you have all materials and information needed for successful completion of your homework, quizzes, and final project.
2. **Article Write-ups** Three times during the semester, students will complete reports on assigned readings. Each report will be 750 words (minimum) reflecting on these readings. Students will be expected to participate in a class discussion on the topic(s) of the readings. Discussion will be used to summarize the readings as well as to explore the themes that emerged in your writings.
3. **Homework** Each week the instructor will direct you to an assignment that must be completed by a specified date. The assignment instructions will be available on Canvas, indicating what is to be turned in for grading.
4. **Quizzes** There will be two quizzes throughout the course of the semester. Questions will be short response. These will reflect material covered in lecture, lab, and assigned readings. Unless noted, you will be given time at beginning of class on the day they are assigned (typically Thursdays) to complete the quiz, though you may complete them at home. Due Date: Midnight on the day they are assigned
5. **Final Project** The semester will culminate in the submission and presentation of a final project. For the final project, you will be asked to complete a GIS project and to present the results to the class. I encourage you to begin to identify topics and appropriate data sets early. I am always open to meeting to discuss potential projects. Additional guidance will be provided via Canvas. Due Date: ______.

## Prepare for this course

Review the course syllabus carefully, paying special attention to due dates and assignment instructions. In addition to a final project, there are several homework assignments in this course and each one builds off the previous, so attendance and participation are crucial. If you have questions about course expectations as reviewed by this syllabus, please contact the instructor as soon as possible.

### Attend class

There are many in-class activities that will require your attendance. Note:

* the majority of your grade depends on your preparation for, and engagement in, class discussions and projects
* your success in completing the exercises, projects, and quizzes largely depends on how well you understand the material that we will cover in class
* throughout the semester, the instructor may assign work to be completed and handed in during class or at our next meeting; you will be responsible for submitting these for credit even if you do not attend class
* in the event of an absence, you should consult the syllabus regarding what material or deadlines you may have missed
* your overall grade will be reduced by 10 percent for 3 or more unexcused absences

Students need to notify the instructor of absences prior to class in writing (or within one week after the absence). S.R. 5.2.4.2 defines the following as acceptable reasons for excused absences: (a) serious illness, (b) illness or death of family member, (c) University-related trips, (d) major religious holidays, and (e) other circumstances found to fit “reasonable cause for nonattendance” by the instructor.

Students anticipating an absence for a major religious holiday are responsible for notifying the instructor in writing of anticipated absences due to their observance of such holidays no later than the last day in the semester to add a class. Information regarding dates of major religious holidays may be obtained through the religious liaison, Mr. Jake Karnes (859-257-2754). Students are expected to withdraw from the class if more than 20% of the classes scheduled for the semester are missed (excused or unexcused) per university policy.

Students may be asked to verify their absences in order for them to be considered excused. Senate Rule 5.2.4.2 states that faculty have the right to request “appropriate verification” when students claim an excused absence because of illness or death in the family. Appropriate notification of absences due to university-related trips is required prior to the absence.

### Be in contact

You are responsible for checking your UKY email account; the class listserv is what will be used to send communications outside class. Email is the best way to contact the instructor (place ‘GEO309’ in the subject heading). Please allow at least 24 hours for a response by email during weekdays. The instructor will not necessarily respond to emails over the weekends.

### Be a resource for others

Students are strongly encouraged to exchange contact information with classmates, in order to retrieve notes and information that you may have missed.

### Ask before recording

Video and audio recordings are not permitted during our class meetings unless the student has received prior permission from the instructors. If permission is granted, recording of other students is prohibited. Any distribution of recordings is also prohibited. Students with specific recording accommodations approved by the Disability Resource Center should present their official documentation to the instructor. All content for this course, including handouts, assignments, and lectures are the intellectual property of the instructors and cannot be reproduced, sold, or used for any purpose other than educational work in this class without prior permission from the instructor.

### Get help

This course is based on a progression of lectures and mapping assignments. If you are having difficulty with any course material, please contact the instructor. There are also other resources which you should find useful:

* Pauer Center for Cartography & GIS in Miller Hall 5, https://geography.as.uky.edu/cartlab
* The University Writing Center, https://uky.mywconline.com
* Map Collections, Science Library in King Library 410C, http://libguides.uky.edu/maps
* Stress Management Workshops in Frazee Hall, http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/Counseling/
* On reading an academic journal article, http://www.brockport.edu/sociology/journal.html

### Meet deadlines

Meeting deadlines is an important professional practice. Consult the course schedule for the due dates of the course assignments. A 10-percent deduction will be applied to the final score of your assignment for submissions after the deadline on the same calendar day, with an additional 10-percent deduction for each additional calendar day the assignment is late. If the assignment is not delivered by the next class meeting, the assignment will not be accepted.

### Be honest

This course, if successful, will expose you to a variety of concepts and techniques. You are expected to draw upon these various ideas, but you must be transparent and honest about your use of these ideas. Please get help if you’re uncertain about this expectation! Per university policy, students shall not plagiarize, cheat, or falsify or misuse academic records. Students are expected to adhere to University policy on cheating and plagiarism in all courses. The minimum penalty for a first offense is a zero on the assignment on which the offense occurred. If the offense is considered severe or the student has other academic offenses on their record, more serious penalties, up to suspension from the university may be imposed.

Plagiarism and cheating are serious breaches of academic conduct. Each student is advised to become familiar with the various forms of academic dishonesty as explained in the **Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities**. Complete information can be found at the following website: http://www.uky.edu/Ombud. A plea of ignorance is not acceptable as a defense against the charge of academic dishonesty. It is important that you review this information as all ideas borrowed from others need to be properly credited.

Part II of **Student Rights and Responsibilities** (available at http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/Code/part2.html) states that all academic work, written or otherwise, submitted by students to their instructors or other academic supervisors, is expected to be the result of their own thought, research, or self-expression. In cases where students feel unsure about the question of plagiarism involving their own work, they are obliged to consult their instructors on the matter before submission.

When students submit work purporting to be their own, but which in any way borrows ideas, organization, wording or anything else from another source without appropriate acknowledgment of the fact, the students are guilty of plagiarism. Plagiarism includes reproducing someone’s work, whether it be a published article, chapter of a book, a paper from a friend or some file, or something similar to this. Plagiarism also includes the practice of employing or allowing another person to alter or revise the work which a student submits as his/her own, whoever that other person may be.

Students may discuss assignments among themselves or with an instructor or tutor, but when the actual work is done, it must be done by the student, and the student alone. When a student’s assignment involves research in outside sources of information, the student must carefully acknowledge exactly what, where and how he/she employed them. If the words of someone else are used, the student must put quotation marks around the passage in question and add an appropriate indication of its origin. Making simple changes while leaving the organization, content and phraseology intact is plagiaristic. However, nothing in these Rules shall apply to those ideas which are so generally and freely circulated as to be a part of the public domain (Section 6.3.1).

**_Please note_**: Any assignment you turn in may be submitted to an electronic database to check for plagiarism.

### Be respectful

Students should at all times be respectful of fellow students, the instructor or teaching assistant(s), and the University of Kentucky. Some basic reminders:

* Silence all mobile devices.
* Show up on time. Late arrivals (and unnecessary) early departures are rude and disruptive.
* Put away your reading material (other than materials necessary for the lecture/course).
* Talking and whispering during class is disrespectful to the instructor and fellow students and makes it more difficult for those who want to learn to do so.
* Be attentive to and respectful of other students’ contributions to class discussions. Discussion must not include attacks of a personal nature, including denigrating another on the basis of skin color, sex, religion, sexual orientation, age, national/regional origin or other such irrelevant factors.

### For students with special needs
