### Course Description

This course introduces students to geographic information systems, their concepts, and their utility. Topics addressed include data collection, processing, analysis, and visualization. Students will learn about types of geographic data and how these data types are to be used. Students will survey and analyze geographic information on the web and learn how to collect spatial data using global positioning systems (GPS) and other technologies.
The purpose of this course is far more than learning GIS as a set of tools. This course is intended to help the student critically engage with the subject matter of GIScience and how it is used to model the spaces and places of everyday life. In doing this, we will examine data, tools, techniques, and outputs of GIS in order to expose the relationship between the cartographer, the map, and those who are being represented by the map. This entails understanding how spatial knowledge and power affect matters of globalized economy, politics, social relations, and much more.
